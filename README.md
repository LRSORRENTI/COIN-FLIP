# COIN-FLIP

building a basic coin flip game, no tutorials, no guardrails, all on my own.... and stack overflow maybe lol

##

##Going to be a coinflip program, might look into three.js later into animating it fully as that
##seems quite interesting, however for now just the basics html, css and, js
##I should also remake this project in React.js and Angular.js for fun,
##And I know I must learn those libraries(React) and frameworks(angular)
##in order to show future emplyoyers my ambition to learn!!
